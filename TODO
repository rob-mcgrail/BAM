So you run BAM! yourscript.rb

And it opens mongerel, and tells you it's there.

So you click run.




Simpler version of BAM - you just give it a command, and it runs it with backticks, grabs output, and posts that
on a server.

If you leave comments, it will print them from mongrel's output

















Bam! Lets you deploy a ruby script to a server for others to use.

It basically routes I-O through javascript. It is very insecure, but you only allow certain commands...

HOW TO GET TEXT FROM SCREEN TO THE TERMINAL


---there's a single button for run

then every subsequent thing is either a gets or a puts

except for output files, which can go to a public directory.



-----------------

Script - includes the argument script.

Then it creates an html page - title of script, comments, etc.

Then it has a button that sends a special request, which mongerel handles as a run command.

Then the browser requests every second for "thing.txt", which mongerel populates with STDOUT.

Files go in /pubic

Everything works. But can I send my string to mongerel, and have it go to gets?
JUST have a say box there the whole time.

Can I overload gets to do something that mongerel will understand, and then push off to the ajax - ie making the input box
highlighted or visible?
